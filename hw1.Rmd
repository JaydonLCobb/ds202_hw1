  A job that I think is related to Data Science would be a **Machine Learning Engineer**, I think that there is a relation between the two because a machine learning engineer uses and creates *algorithms and models* in order to make predictions on data. They also attempt to find patterns within data and in my experience so far that seems very similiar to what data science is.
